#<h1> CVE-2021-41773/42013</h1>
<p>Room that covers an Apache path traversal bug. Note that path traversal is a web vulnerability involving unintended navigation of a directory structure. Mitigation involves input validation and sanitization. </p>
<hl>

<p>Apache is the most widely used web server software. Is open source and allows users to deploy website to the internet. </p>
<hl>
<p>Common Gateway Interface (CGI) files are an interface which tells the webserver how to pass data to and from an application. </p>

<h3> What is URL Encoding?: </h3>
<p>URL encoding is the process of encoding special or reserved characters within a URL. For example, a period ". " After being URL encoded is the percent `%` sign followed by its hexadecimal code `2E` making its encoded value `%2E`. URL encoding is not specific to special/reserved characters and full URLs can be encoded. Using the encoded characters is what allows for traversing outside the root by getting past character filters</p>
<hl>
<h3> Final Thoughts: </h3>
- This CVE is exploited by curling web servers trying to access directories outside what is intended by the server by encoding special characters to get past filters which then allows a malicious actor to view files and possibly remotely execute code using a reverse shell.
